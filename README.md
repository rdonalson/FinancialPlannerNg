# FinancialPlannerNg
This project is a redesign of the original Financial Planner that was engineered in .Net Framework MVC 5 and Identity Server Security.
In this version the UI is designed in Angular 11, with a .Net Core API and using Azure Active Directory securing both.  The UI and API will be hosted on the Azure Cloud.
